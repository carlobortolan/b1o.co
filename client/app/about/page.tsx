          used in chess, each image is assigned a rating. When a user votes for
          an image, it&apos;s considered a &quot;win&quot; for that image
          against the one it was compared to. The winning image gains points
          depending on the difference in ratings between the two images. If the
          winning image had a lower rating initially, it would gain more points.
          Conversely, if it had a higher rating, it would gain fewer points. The
          losing image loses the same number of points that the winning image
          gains.
